    <p>The ideal course companion, Elements of Physical Chemistry is written specifically with the needs of
        undergraduate students in mind and provides extensive mathematical and pedagogical support while remaining
        concise and accessible.
        The International Edition organizes the material into short Topics, which are grouped into thematic Focuses to
        make the text digestible for students and flexible for lecturers to teach from. At the beginning of each Topic,
        three questions are posed, emphasizing why it is important, what the key idea is and what the student should
        already know.
