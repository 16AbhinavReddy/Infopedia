                        In 2016, a company called Gryphon Scientific published a report that had been commissioned bythe US government. It wrote in 
                        the report that virus research facilities had a small but non-zero risk of beingable to cause a pandemic. It estimated
                        that an accidental infection from a US-based influenza virus or coronavirus laboratory could happen once every three to 8.5
                        years and that the chance of that infection leading to a global pandemic...

                        Figuring out how to feed people in space is a major part of a larger effort to demonstrate the viability of long-term human
                        habitation of extraterrestrial environments. On May 12, 2022, a team of scientists announced that they had successfully 
                        grown plants using lunar soil gathered during the Apollo moon missions. But this is not the first time that scientists 
                        have attempted to grow plants in soils that typically do not support life...

                        Suppose a couple has two children, a boy and a girl. Chances are, they’ll both grow up with typical, healthy brains. But
                        should either diverge from the usual route of brain development, or suffer mental health issues, their paths are likely to

                        to be diagnosed with autism. Rates of other neurodevelopmental conditions and disabilities are also higher in boys. As he

                        On a sunny September morning in 2011, at a conference on the Mediterranean island of Malta, virologist Ron Fouchier made
                        an announcement that shook the scientific world. His lab, he said, had taken H5N1 avian influenza virus – which kills
                        around 60% of people with known cases, but which cannot spread easily from person to person – and altered it to transmit
                        among mammals. He had created, he told a reporter later that year, “probably one of the mostdangerous viruses you can make.” 
                        Fouchier and others have said such research can help scientists prepare for future pandemics. But several thousand miles 
                        away in Massachusetts, Lynn Klotz reacted...

                        Physicists have created a system of two connected time crystals, which are strange quantum systems that are stuck in an 
                        endless loop to which the normal laws of thermodynamics do not apply. By connecting two time crystals together, the 
                        physicists hope to use the technology to eventually build a new kind of quantum computer. “It is a rare privilege
                        to explore a completely novel phase of matter,” Samuli Autti, the lead scientist...

                        Bayesian probabilistic modeling is supported by powerful computational tools like probabilistic programming and efficient 
                        Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. However, the results of Bayesian inference are challenging for users to interpret
                        in tasks like decision-making under uncertainty or model refinement. Decision-makers need simultaneous insight into both the 
                        model's structure and its predictions, including uncertainty in inferred parameters. This enables better assessment of the 
                        risk overall possible outcomes compatible with observations and thus more informed decisions. To support this, we see a 
                        need for visualization tools...

                        Outer space isn’t what most people would think of as an ecosystem. Its barren and frigid void isn’t exactly akin to the 
                        verdant canopies of a rainforest or to the iridescent shoals that swim among coral cities. But ifwe are to become better 
                        stewards of the increasingly frenzied band of orbital space above our atmosphere, a shift to thinking of it as an ecosystem 
                        – as part of an interconnected system of living things interacting with their physical environment – may be just what we 
                        need. Last month, in the journal Nature Astronomy, a collective of 11 astrophysicists and space scientists proposed we do 
                        just that, citing the proliferation of anthropogenic space objects. Thousands of satellites currently orbit the Earth, with
