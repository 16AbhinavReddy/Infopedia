    <p>An Inspiration The Holocaust was one of the most horrendous and terrible eras in history. Innumerable books have
        been written describing the horrors of the Holocaust; but nothing beats the documentation of a family who had
        gone into hiding in the diary of a little girl, Anne Frank. Honest, lucid and empathetic; The Diary of A Young
        Girl deserves a read by everyone who has ever questioned mental strength of humans and also by those who cannot
        come to terms with the cruelties that could be inflicted by humans upon fellow humans. The original diary was
        published by Otto Frank in Dutch in 1947 and it was first translated to English in 1952, as The Diary of A Young
        Girl. Since then, it has been translated to more than sixty languages and people all over the world have read,
        loved and cried over the memoirs of Anne Frank.</p>
