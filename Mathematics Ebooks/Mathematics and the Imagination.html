    <p>You don’t have to love math to enjoy a hand of cards, a night at the casino, or a puzzle. But your pleasure and
        prowess at games, gambling, and other numerically related pursuits can be heightened with this entertaining
        volume, in which the authors offer a fascinating view of some of the lesser-known and more imaginative aspects
        of mathematics.
        A brief and breezy explanation of the new language of mathematics precedes a smorgasbord of such
        thought-provoking subjects as the googolplex (the largest definite number anyone has yet bothered to conceive
        of); assorted geometries — plane and fancy; famous puzzles that made mathematical history; and tantalizing
        paradoxes. Gamblers receive fair warning on the laws of chance; a look at rubber-sheet geometry twists circles
        into loops without sacrificing certain important properties; and an exploration of the mathematics of change and
        growth shows how calculus, among its other uses, helps trace the path of falling bombs.
