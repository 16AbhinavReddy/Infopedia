    <p>This concise text offers undergraduates in mathematics and science a thorough and systematic first course in
        elementary differential equations. Presuming a knowledge of basic calculus, the book first reviews the
        mathematical essentials required to master the materials to be presented.
        The next four chapters take up linear equations, those of the first order and those with constant coefficients,
        variable coefficients, and regular singular points. The last two chapters address the existence and uniqueness
        of solutions to both first order equations and to systems and n-th order equations. He has also included
        problems (with answers) selected to sharpen understanding of the mathematical structure of the subject, and to
        introduce a variety of relevant topics not covered in the text, e.g. stability, equations with periodic
        coefficients, and boundary value problems.
