    <p> These notes will cover the principal fundamental data structures and algorithms used in computer science, and bring together a broad range of topics covered elsewhere into a coherent framework. Data structures will be formulated to represent various types of information in such a way that it can be conveniently and efficiently manipulated by the algorithms we develop.</p>
